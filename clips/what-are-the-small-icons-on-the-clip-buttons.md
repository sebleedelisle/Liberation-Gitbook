Sometimes you will see small symbols on the clip buttons :&#x20;

* **Microphone symbol&#x20;**_**-**_ this clip has a _Sound Input_ oscillator, and will respond to audio in some way.&#x20;
* **MIDI symbol** - this clip has a _MIDI Notes_ node, so responds to MIDI input. &#x20;
* **T** - this clip has been played with the Timeline rather than manually.&#x20;

If the clip uses the _Zone delay / chase_ system, you'll see three dots on the clip button. These animate in a way that represents the zone delay settings.&#x20;

* Zone delay - the dots will animate up and down with a delay
* Chase - the dots will flash on and off
* Delay with re-trigger - the dots will animate with a reset on every repeat.&#x20;
