# ðŸŸ§ Starting / stopping clips

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the on screen buttons to start and stop clips, but it's much better to use the APC40 midi controller. Liberation has been optimised to work well with this hardware and should be considered an important part of your investment into lasers.&#x20;

**Default mode :** Press the clip button to start it, press again to stop it.&#x20;

**Flash mode :** Press the clip button to start it, release the button to stop it. \*

\*Flash mode is a [Group](groups.md) setting.&#x20;

When you start a clip, all other clips in the same group will stop.&#x20;

To **keep the previous clips running** when you start a new clip in the same group :&#x20;

* press SHIFT first, and then start the new clip, or
* re-press the running clip(s) and then while that clip is still pressed, start the next clip. When you release both buttons, they will both stay running.&#x20;

To **stop all the clips running** press the **STOP** button.&#x20;

To stop all the clips running in a particular group, press its group button, then press the **STOP** button.&#x20;

To stop all clips except one, press the running clip you wish to keep, then while it is down, also press the **STOP** button. Then release the clip button.&#x20;

### Timing

Clips by default are set to _retrigger_. This means that no matter when you press it, the clip will start running from that moment. So if you start it late, the clip's animation will be slightly late and out of time. If _retrigger_ is turned off, the clip will behave as though it has always been running from the very start of the clock, so will always be in time with the tempo.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Clips are often designed to loop forever but you can design them in such a way that they only run once or a few times around. Make sure to keep those set to _retrigger_, or they won't restart!
