# âœ… Assigning clips to laser zones

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/clips-zones" alt=""><figcaption><p>The zone buttons at the top, and the Flip X / Flip Y buttons at the bottom.</p></figcaption></figure>

Underneath the clips, you can see a row of zone buttons (both on-screen and reflected on the APC40), marked _BEAM 1_ to _BEAM 8_ by default. Use these buttons to toggle zones for the _currently selected clip_.

#### Scrolling through the zones

If there are more than 8 zones you can scroll left and right using :

* SHIFT plus the <- and -> cursor keys
* The _DEV ON/OFF_ and _DEV LOCK_ buttons on the APC40

### Flip X and Y

Underneath each zone button you can see buttons marked _X_ and _Y._ These flip the output to each zone horizontally and vertically, respectively.

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't need to make a new zone to have different mirror settings. The X and Y flip settings apply to this clip only, they're not a setting of the zone.
