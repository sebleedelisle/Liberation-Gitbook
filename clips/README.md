# ðŸŸ§ Clips & Clip deck

### What is a clip?

All laser content within Liberation is stored inside of clips.

Clips can contain atmospheric beam effects or graphical animations and they are usually a looping cycle. They can be directed into any zone (or Canvas Target Area) and are triggered using the clip buttons inside the clipdeck.

Clip content is created using the versatile node-based clip editor system. (See [clip-editor.md](../designing-content/clip-editor.md "mention") for more details)

### The clip deck

The clip deck is the on-screen grid of clips and it usually extends beyond the visible area that you can see.

Scroll the clip deck left and right using :

* The left and right arrow keys
* Trackpad 2 finger swipe (or mouse scroll left and right if your mouse can do that!)
* The _Cue Level_ scroll wheel on the APC40

Scroll the clip deck a full page left and right using :

* CMD/CTRL plus the left and right arrow keys
* The _Device <- and ->_ buttons on the APC40

#### The mini clip visualiser

Along the top of the clip deck you will see a small representation of the entire clip deck. The lit up section represents the clips that are currently visible.
