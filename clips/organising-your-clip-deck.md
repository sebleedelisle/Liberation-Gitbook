# 🟩 Organising your clip deck

### Moving/duplicating clips

Click and drag to move a clip. If more than one clip is selected (see [starting-stopping-clips.md](starting-stopping-clips.md "mention")) they will all be moved. Hold down ALT/OPTION to duplicate them. Drop the clip(s) onto an empty space.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to select a large number of clips, you can click / drag a lasso, and then scroll the clipdeck while still dragging (either using cursor keys, the APC 40 or sideways touchpad/mouse scroll). The lasso will be extended off the edge of the clip deck.
{% endhint %}

### Deleting clips

To delete a single clip, use the right click menu.

To delete multiple clips, select them (either with ALT-SHIFT click or by dragging the lasso) and drag them off the clip deck.

### Adding empty space

You can right-click on a clip button and press _ADD EMPTY COLUMN TO RIGHT_ to add an empty column of space to the clip deck.

### Combining multiple clip decks

You can import an existing clip deck and append it to the end of current clip deck. Use menu _File -> Clips/Effects -> Append Clip Deck._

Make a selection of clips (with either the lasso or ALT-SHIFT click) and then _File -> Clips/Effects -> Export Selected Clips._ This will export a clip deck with only those clips, which can then be appended to another clip deck.

### Organising clips by timeline

When you import a timeline you also have some clip options. You can either replace the current clip deck, append the timeline's entire clip deck, or just the clips it uses.

If you have multiple timelines in your project, you can reorganise your clips by timeline. Open the _Timeline selection_ panel, and click _ORGANISE CLIPS BY TIMELINE_. You will now see all of your clips in groups based on their timeline. If a clip is used in multiple timelines, it will be duplicated for each group.
