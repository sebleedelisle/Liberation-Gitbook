# ðŸŸ¦ Organising your clip deck

### Moving/duplicating clips

Click and drag to move a clip. If more than one clip is selected (see [starting-stopping-clips.md](starting-stopping-clips.md "mention")) they will all be moved. Hold down ALT/OPTION to duplicate them. Drop the clip(s) onto an empty space.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to select a large number of clips, you can click / drag a lasso, and then scroll the clipdeck while still dragging (either using cursor keys, the APC 40 or sideways touchpad/mouse scroll). The lasso will be extended off the edge of the clip deck.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Deleting clips

To delete a single clip, use the right click menu.&#x20;

To delete multiple clips, select them (either with ALT-SHIFT click or by dragging the lasso) and drag them off the clip deck.&#x20;

### Combining multiple clip decks

You can import an existing clip deck and append it to the end of current clip deck. Use menu _File->Clips/Effects->Append Clip Deck._&#x20;

Make a selection of clips (with either the lasso or ALT-SHIFT click) and then _File->Clips/Effects->Export Selected Clips._ This will export a clip deck with only those clips, which can then be appended to another clip deck.&#x20;

### Organising clips by timeline

When you import a timeline you also have some clip options. You can either replace the current clip deck, append the timeline's entire clip deck, or just the clips it uses.&#x20;

If you have multiple timelines in your project, you can reorganise your clips by timeline. Open the _Timeline selection_ window, and click _ORGANISE CLIPS BY TIMELINE_. You will now see all of your clips in groups based on their timeline. If a clip is used in multiple timelines, it will be duplicated for each group.&#x20;
