## SAFETY WARNING

**LASERS CAN BE DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE EYE AND SKIN DAMAGE, DO NOT POINT THEM AT HUMANS, ANIMALS OR IN THE SKY. UNMOVING BEAMS CAN BURN PROPERTY. ENSURE THAT   INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES AND LOCAL LAWS ARE ADHERED TO AT ALL TIMES.**&#x20;

Before you start using lasers, you must get safety training. In the UK I can recommend [LVR Optical](https://www.lvroptical.com/laser-safety-training.html). You are wholly responsible for using Liberation safely!
