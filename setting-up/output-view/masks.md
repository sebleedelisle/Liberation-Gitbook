**SAFETY NOTICE**&#x20;

Software masks should NEVER be your only method to protect humans from the output of a laser. You should always have physical barriers / masking between the laser and any potential human exposure. Consider this system as a secondary level of redundancy or for non-safety critical applications (like protecting cameras or projectors) but remember that any software can fail.&#x20;

***

You can add one or more virtual masks to remove (or reduce) laser output in specific places.&#x20;

Add a mask by clicking on the icon in the toolbar; you'll see a red square appear in the output view and this is your new mask. You can move it around by clicking and dragging, and drag the corners to change its size. If you want a non-uniform shape, press ALT/OPTION while dragging a corner. (Once the mask is non-uniform, you no longer need to press the ALT/OPTION key.)&#x20;

Right click on the mask to see additional settings :&#x20;

* Reduction percentage - this represents the power reduction for the laser within the mask. By default it's set to 100%, ie full blackout within the mask. But you can reduce the laser power by any amount that you choose. Note that when it's not a full reduction, the mask changes colour to orange.&#x20;
* The DELETE MASK button is also in this right click menu.&#x20;
