# ðŸŸ¦ Test patterns

While editing and adjusting your zone, it's useful to output a test pattern. You can turn on a test pattern across every enabled zone using the toggle button in the top icon bar, and choose the test pattern using the slider to the right of it.&#x20;

If you want a test pattern only on the laser you're currently zoning, use the toggle button on the toolbar on the left of the _Output_ view. Click/drag the number beneath it to select the test pattern.&#x20;

### Test pattern list

Here is a full list of the test patterns. The patterns fill the entire output space of each zone, unless specified otherwise.&#x20;

1. Default pattern - a green rectangle with a cross through it. It uses green so it can be more visible at low brightnesses.&#x20;
2. Registration pattern - a combination of blue and green circles, with a white and red grid. Useful for architectural mapping as you can use the shape of the circle to get the correct aspect ratio.
3. Horizontal green lines - 4 horizontal lines, evenly spaced.
4. Vertical green lines - 4 vertical lines, evenly spaced.

Colour calibration patterns 5-8. These can be used alongside the colour correction system within the laser settings. See [Colour calibration](../../advanced/colour-calibration.md). These patterns do not fill the entire output space. &#x20;

5. Colour calibration pattern - red.&#x20;
6. Colour calibration pattern - green.
7. Colour calibration pattern - blue.
8. Colour calibration pattern - white.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Caution** -  test pattern 9 can be very dangerous and should be used only once you have determined that the zone is safe. The bright unmoving spots can cause burning on surfaces. If using in the sky make sure you have the necessary licenses/permissions and constantly check for aircraft.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

9. Bright white dots - one full power dot in each corner. It's the most visible pattern so it's good for zoning in bright areas or into the sky.&#x20;
10. Scanning white line - a vertical white line that scans left and right across the full width of the zone. This covers the entirety of the zone so is great for testing your masking and making sure that glitter-balls or other hazards are avoided.&#x20;
11. White rectangle - a bright white rectangle.&#x20;
