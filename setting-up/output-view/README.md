# ðŸŸ¦ Output view / Zones

The Output view is a representation of the full output range of each laser. In this view you can adjust its zones and add mask areas.&#x20;

Select the Output view by clicking on the _OUTPUT_ button in the top tool bar.

### Selecting a laser

Use the number buttons at the top to choose which laser you are editing. Or use the TAB key to cycle through them. Or hit a number key.&#x20;

### Navigating around the Output view&#x20;

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Click and drag on any empty space (or on locked zones) to move the view around.&#x20;

### Toolbar icons

On the left of the view you'll see the toolbar. Hover your mouse over any icon to see what it does.

* Add beam zone to the laser
* Select which canvas zones are in this laser&#x20;
* Add a mask to the laser
* Toggle the test pattern for this laser
* Choose the test pattern for this laser (overrides the main test pattern)
* Toggle snapping to the grid
