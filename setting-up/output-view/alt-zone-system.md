# ðŸŸ¦ Alt zone system

Have you ever been in a situation where you might need to instantly move or disable a selection of zones? For example :

* A number of zones going in to the sky that you need to redirect to terminate onto buildings if an aircraft goes by.&#x20;
* Zones that enter an unused balcony level that you need to redirect in certain parts of the show while crew are there.&#x20;

The Alt zone system lets you create an alternate zone for any existing zone, and with a single button, switch to all the alternates at once.&#x20;

### Switching to your Alt zones

As soon as you add any alt zone a toggle button appears in the top icon bar labelled _ALT ZONES._ Click this button to toggle between your alt zones and your regular zones.

### Adding an alternate zone

In the output view, right click on a zone and click _ADD ALT ZONE_. Notice that a new green coloured zone appears. You can edit and adjust this in exactly the same way as any of your zones. You'll need to enable Alt zones in the top icon bar in order to see the test patterns.&#x20;

### How to disable instead of move a zone

Add an Alt zone, right click on it and click the _Disable output_ button (circle with a line through it). Now when you enable Alt zones, content will be redirected to this now disabled alt zone.&#x20;
