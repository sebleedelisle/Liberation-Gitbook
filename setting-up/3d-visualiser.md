# ðŸŸ¦ Setting up your project

When you open Liberation for the first time, it has the default set up. But you'll likely want to adjust it to more closely match your own set up or change it for a particular show.&#x20;

Here is an overview of the process :

1.  **Change the number of lasers in your project :**&#x20;

    In the _Laser Overview_ window, click the red button on the side of any laser to delete it. Add a new laser - click the _ADD LASER_ button underneath the list of lasers.&#x20;
2.  **Update the 3D visualiser view :**&#x20;

    Adjust the position and orientation of each laser using the _3D Visualiser Settings_ Window. See [3d-visualiser-1.md](3d-visualiser-1.md "mention").&#x20;
3. **Adjust the zones :** \
   In the _OUTPUT_ view you can check the zones. Tab through each laser or click one of the numbered buttons at the top of the view. Adjust each zone as you require, or even add new zones. See [output-view](output-view/ "mention").
4. **Change each clip's zones :** \
   Trigger each clip by clicking its button, and then toggle the zones and the X and Y flip using the on screen buttons. See [clips](../running-a-show/clips/ "mention").
5. Connect to your controllers : when you're ready to plug your lasers in and go, open the _Controller Assignment_ Window. See [controller-assignment.md](controller-assignment.md "mention").&#x20;
