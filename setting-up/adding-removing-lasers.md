When you add a new laser, a beam zone is automatically added to it. Note that lasers and zones are sorted in the order that you add them. See [re-ordering-beam-zones.md](../output-view/re-ordering-beam-zones.md "mention").

Remove a laser by clicking the red "-" button in the _Laser overview_ panel. Note that you will lose all of your laser settings!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to copy zones or other settings from other lasers, use [copy-laser-settings.md](laser-settings/copy-laser-settings.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Notice that whenever you do something potentially dangerous like deleting a laser, you'll get a confirmation dialog. If you want to bypass this, press CMD/CTRL while clicking the button. Naturally, use this with caution!
