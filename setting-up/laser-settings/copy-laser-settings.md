# ðŸŸ¦ Copy settings between lasers

Click on the _COPY LASER SETTINGS_ button in _Laser Output_ and a new window will open.&#x20;

This is an incredibly useful and time saving feature for quickly copying zones and other settings from one laser to the others.&#x20;

Make sure you have selected the laser you want to copy settings _from._&#x20;

Toggle on all the other lasers you want to copy settings _to_. (Use _ALL_ and _NONE_ to make this quicker if you have a lot of lasers)

Select which settings you want to copy :&#x20;

* **Copy output zone positions&#x20;**_**-**_ copies the zone positions / size / type from one laser to the others. Note that it copies the zones in order, so laser 1 zones 1 and 9 will be copied to laser 2 zones 2 and 10. Alt zones will also be copied.&#x20;
* **Copy scanner / speed settings** - copies the scanner speed and scanner preset but _not_ _Colour shift._
* **Copy colour settings -** copies all of the colour calibration settings
* **Copy advanced settings -** includes point rate, smooth home position, target frame rate and all the other advanced settings.&#x20;

When you've made your selection click the _COPY SETTINGS_ button to complete the process.&#x20;
