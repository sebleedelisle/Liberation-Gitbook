### Timeline Interface

If you‚Äôve used music or video software before, the concept of a timeline will feel familiar: it‚Äôs a horizontal grid where time moves from left to right, and you can place clips along it to define what plays when.

If you're new to timelines, think of it like a musical score or a stage cue sheet - each block is a piece of that content triggered at a specific moment. It‚Äôs a structured way to design how your laser show unfolds over time.

#### Timeline Bar Controls

**Enable Button**

Before you can interact with the timeline, it must be enabled. Click the **ENABLE** toggle (orange when active) to activate the timeline for editing and playback.

**Timeline Name**

The current timeline‚Äôs name is shown next to the enable button (default is **‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù**). Click it to rename - useful when managing multiple songs or segments.

**Timeline List (Three Bars Icon)**

Click this to open the timeline list. From here, you can switch between timelines or add/remove them from your show.

**Lock Button**

Protect your timeline from accidental changes. When enabled, editing is disabled until unlocked.

**Add Clips Button**

Adds all currently selected clips from your clip deck into the timeline at the current playhead position. Great for building up a timeline from a live performance or a prepared selection.

**Insert Audio File**

Opens a file dialog to choose an audio file to insert at the start of the timeline. Supported formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC. Useful for syncing your timeline to music.

**Default Clip Duration**

Sets the default length (in bars) for new clips added to the timeline using drag or the + button. Speeds up your workflow when building sequences.

**Volume**

Adjusts the playback volume of all audio clips on the timeline. Does not affect laser output.

#### Sync and Timing

**Tempo Map Button**

Enables tempo mapping. When on, a new row appears at the top of the timeline where you can right-click to add tempo changes. Ideal for tracks that change tempo or include tempo ramps.

**Timecode Panel**

Opens the timecode settings panel. Here you can configure Liberation to sync to LTC, MIDI Clock, or Ableton Link for perfect alignment with external systems.

**SNAP Toggle**

When enabled, clips and edits snap to the grid. This makes precise alignment easy. Disable for free placement.

#### View and Playback Behavior

**Auto Scroll (Skater Icon)**

When enabled, the timeline will automatically scroll to follow the playhead during playback.

**Scrub Mode (Light Bulb Icon)**

When enabled, lasers are live while you move the playhead manually. Helpful for previewing specific frames, but use with care, especially with powerful projectors.

**Loop Playback**

Loops the timeline from the beginning to the set timeline length. Good for working on specific sections or running background visuals.

**Timeline Length**

Sets the total length of the timeline in bars. Drag to adjust, or double-click to enter a number directly.
