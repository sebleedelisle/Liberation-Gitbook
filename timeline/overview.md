# ðŸŸ§ Overview

The Timeline in Liberation is completely integrated, not a separate editor or bolt-on module. It shares the same clip deck and content as live performance, meaning anything you can do live can also be recorded, sequenced, and refined in the timeline. Whether you're designing tightly synced laser shows or planning a full set for playback, the timeline gives you total creative control without compromise.

At the heart of the timeline is a musical grid of beats and bars. This approach means your creative edits and live recordings are naturally aligned to the musicâ€™s rhythm, ensuring:

* **Effortless Tempo Changes:** When the tempo shifts, thereâ€™s no need to painstakingly re-align every element - the system automatically maintains synchronisation.
* **Rearrange without losing sync :** Clips snap directly to the beat, making it quick and easy to rearrange your shows without the risk of losing timing integrity.

Liberation supports full timecode synchronisation, including external LTC input via any standard audio interface. You can set up multiple timelines for different songs or segments, and theyâ€™ll launch automatically when the incoming timecode reaches the right moment - perfect for complex multi-track performances.

If youâ€™re not using timecode, no problem: Liberation also supports MIDI clock, Ableton Link, or even manual tempo control. That means you can design a timeline show and manually synchronise to a band, even if theyâ€™re not using a click track.

Liberationâ€™s timeline is built to be fast, dependable, and rock-solid in the high-pressure environment of a live show or touring rig.
