#### Unable to deauthorise on Windows?

If you are unable to deauthorise a computer on Windows, make sure you deauthorise the licence using the same version of Liberation that was originally authorised, before authorising it again in a different version.

If you no longer have access to original version, please contact support@liberationlaser.com and we can deauthorise the machine manually for you.

**Why this happens**

In early Windows builds of Liberation, we used the recommended system method for generating a machine ID. Unfortunately, this proved to be unreliable and could fail in some cases, particularly when Liberation was not run with administrator privileges. Because of this, we later rewrote the licensing system to use a more robust combination of methods, which now works reliably.

As a result, the computer ID used by older versions of Liberation is different from the one used by current versions, which is why deauthorisation must be done from the same version that originally authorised the machine.
