#### Where to find the working folder

Each version of Liberation has its own working folder. For example, if you’re running version 1.0.0, the folder name will be 1.0.0.

* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Liberation/1.0.0`
* **Windows**: `AppData\Local\Liberation\1.0.0`

**How to open the folder quickly**

**macOS**

1. In Finder, press **Shift+Cmd+G**.
2.  Paste this path and press **Enter**:

    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Liberation
    ```
3. Open the folder that matches your version number, for example `1.0.0`.
