# ✅ Intermittent / flashing output

Open the _Laser Overview_ panel and look at the connection light next to the laser you are having trouble with.&#x20;

**If the connection light IS NOT constantly green :**\
Then you have either a network or a CPU performance issue :

**Network performance -**

* Make sure you are not connected to a wifi network. You should always use a wired connection. Make sure your operating system is prioritising the wired network over wifi or disable wifi if you’re not sure
* check your network adaptor - and try a different USB-C adaptor
* Windows users - check / upgrade your network drivers, run the appropriate network testing tools
* check all wiring, switches, routers. Methodically swap out and test every cable.
* restart all of your network gear, including switches, routers and every Ether Dream.

**CPU performance**

if you have an old or low spec machine it may be too slow to run Liberation. Check the frame rate indicator in the right hand side of the icon bar.

There are two numbers there - the actual frame rate and the target frame rate. If the actual frame rate drops below 30, you may have issues.

The following actions may help :

* remove unused lasers, ie if you only have one laser connected, delete the others.
* Switch to the output or canvas view
* Close all other programs, check network firewall settings, close anti-virus, dropbox, etc.
* Reduce your display resolution, and make the Liberation window smaller

If none of this works then consider upgrading your computer.

**If the connection light IS constantly green :**

Then it’s likely to be a hardware issue. This is out of scope of this manual but you can try the following actions :

* Disable the SFS (Scan Fail Safety) system. Some lasers have a function that disables output if the scanners stop moving ie producing a strong static beam. They can be a little overcautious / unreliable.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Use extreme caution when disabling the scan fail safety system. Strong static beams can cause burning! Make sure you have a stop button and a fire extinguisher on hand.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Check interlock cables and systems
* Check all cabling between the controller and the laser.
