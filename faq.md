# ðŸŸ§ FAQ

### General

**Does Liberation run on Windows?**

Yes, Windows 10 or 11 64 bit machines (TBC)

**Does Liberation run on Mac**

Yes, MacOS 12.xxxx and later

**What is the minimum spec machine required?**

It depends how many lasers you want to control. If you're only running a few lasers, you'll be fine with a low spec machine. Any Apple Silicon Mac runs really well, and should be able to control up to 100 lasers. If you're running complex shows with high stakes then we recommend the best machine you can afford.

**How many lasers can I control with Liberation?**

Liberation can run many lasers on one computer, it's been tested with over 100 laser controllers so the answer depends on :

* your computer CPU
* network speed
* your subscription type

**What are the limitations between the 3 subscription tiers?**

* Hobbyist tier - 2 x laser controllers and 2 x DMX fixtures
* Pro tier - 8 x laser controllers and 8 x DMX fixtures
* Unlimited tier - as many lasers and DMX fixtures as your system can handle

Note that you can set up and preview as many lasers as you want on **every** tier, and there are no other limitations at all apart from the number of lasers that you can _arm_. Every other Liberation feature is available to all.

**How do I sync Liberation to music?**

It has an intelligent "tap tempo" system that works as you would expect, but you can also use an external MIDI clock or Ableton Link. The timeline can be synced to incoming LTC/SMPTE timecode coming in via any audio interface.&#x20;

**Which MIDI controllers can I use?**

Liberation has been designed and optimised around the popular APC40 Mk2 MIDI controller. It also works with the APC40 Mk1.

I will be working on other MIDI control implementations in the future, along with customisable MIDI mapping but for now it is only the APC40 Mk 1 and 2(recommended).

### Laser controllers

**Which laser controllers are compatible with Liberation?**

* [Ether Dream (recommended)](https://ether-dream.com)
* [Helios DAC](https://bitlasers.com/helios-laser-dac/)
* Mercury (in beta testing)
* LaserCube USB (and LaserDock)
* LaserCube Wifi protocol (with a wired network connection)

To be supported in future :

* IDN

**Why don't you support \[other brand of] laser controller?**

To encourage greater interoperability between software and hardware, Liberation will only support DACs that have a published communication protocol. I believe that this is the best way forward for the laser industry.

**How can I tell if my laser can be used with Liberation?**

If your laser has one of the following, you can use it with Liberation :

* An external ILDA input - it's a 25 pin D connector, and you will need a compatible external controller.
* An internally installed Ether Dream
* A LaserCube with either a USB input or a network socket.
* An X-Laser unit with a built-in Mercury system (currently in testing)

**Can I use Liberation with my LaserCube?**

Yes, Liberation works directly with any LaserCube.&#x20;

**How often do I need to connect my computer to the internet?**

Every time the subscription renews you will need to connect Liberation to the internet to update its internal license. It's a monthly subscription, you will need to connect every month.

Liberation will give you a grace period of 7 days after your license renews to connect to the internet and update its internal license.

**Can I deauthorise Liberation on a computer that has been lost or stolen?**

* You can deauthorise the computer via the website, but this will only take effect when the subscription renews or when the computer connects to the internet, whichever comes first. If you urgently need to re-authorise a new computer get in touch with support.&#x20;
