## SAFETY WARNING

**LASERS CAN BE DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE EYE AND SKIN DAMAGE, DO NOT POINT THEM AT HUMANS, ANIMALS OR IN THE SKY. UNMOVING BEAMS CAN BURN PROPERTY. ENSURE THAT INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES AND LOCAL LAWS ARE ADHERED TO AT ALL TIMES.**

For a first-time safe setup walkthrough, follow [Setting up your lasers](setting-up/setting-up-lasers.md).

Before you start using lasers publicly, you must get safety training. In the UK I can recommend [LVR Optical](https://www.lvroptical.com/laser-safety-training.html). You are wholly responsible for using Liberation safely!

PLASA have a free downloadable laser safety guide which has been generally accepted as industry best practice: [https://www.plasa.org/guidance-for-display-lasers/](https://www.plasa.org/guidance-for-display-lasers/)

### Also adhere to these safety precautions:

- Keep beams out of audience eyes: aim above 3m in audience areas; use attenuators/beam blocks while positioning; never aim at people or animals.
- Always use interlocks, E-stop, and keyswitches—never bypass or tape them down.
- Liberation does not enforce MPE limits or scan-fail detection; manage power, add external safety systems, and follow local regulations
- First power-on checklist: start with test patterns at lowest output, keep shutters closed until ready, bring up one projector at a time, confirm zones/masks before adding more. [Setting up your lasers](setting-up/setting-up-lasers.md).
