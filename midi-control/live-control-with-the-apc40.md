### **APC40 controller**&#x20;

This is the default hardware controller for Liberation; it's highly recommended and it's fair to say that Liberation has been designed around this hardware from the very beginning. As soon as you plug in the APC40, Liberation immediately connects to it automatically.&#x20;

_Oh no! My USB plug got pulled half way through a show!_&#x20;

Don't panic - just plug it back in, Liberation will automatically reconnect, no drama.&#x20;

### APC40 Mark 1 or Mark 2?&#x20;

In short, Mark 2 is recommended as it has full colour buttons that more closely match the Liberation clip deck interface. The Mark 1 version will work in a pinch, but it will be a little more confusing as the layout is slightly different from what is on screen, and the buttons can only turn red, orange or green, so will not match the clip colours.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The original APC40 Mark 1 came out in 2009(!) and some people still prefer it for its metal body construction and its robust console-like form factor. The Updated Mark 2 came out in 2014, and although it was discontinued in 2024, it's going back into production in 2025 due to demand from visuals artists (Resolume etc) and laserists.
