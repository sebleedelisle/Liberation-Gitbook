# ðŸŸ¦ MIDI control overview

There are several ways that Liberation uses MIDI:&#x20;

* As a live controller, with the APC 40. See [live-control-with-the-apc40.md](live-control-with-the-apc40.md "mention").
* As a clock sync source, using MIDI clock and MIDI song position messages. See [synchronisation.md](../synchronisation.md "mention")
* As an interactive input on the MIDI notes node to create "laser harp" style effects. See  [midi-notes.md](../clip-editor/operator-nodes/midi-notes.md "mention")
* As a more general input/output system using the MIDI Send/Receive system. See  [midi-send-receive.md](midi-send-receive.md "mention")
