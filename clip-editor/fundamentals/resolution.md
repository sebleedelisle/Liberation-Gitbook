# ðŸŸ¦ Resolution

Most _Creators_ have a _resolution_ option. This is an advanced setting that determines how many subdivisions the shapes have, and can affect how jagged the shapes are when subsequently stretched and manipulated by modifiers.&#x20;

The value represents the size of the subdivisions so therefore a lower value is a higher resolution. The default of 4 is fine for most clips but if you need finer quality you can consider reducing this number. Note that a higher resolution requires more CPU. &#x20;
