&#x20;Description

* **hue, saturation, brightness** - the colour values, see [colour-settings-and-hsb.md](../fundamentals/colour-settings-and-hsb.md "mention")&#x20;
* **hue mode** -&#x20;
  * OFF - the hue isn't changed
  * FIXED - the hue of elements is set to the hue value
  * SHIFT - the hue of elements is offset by the value, so different coloured elements will remain different, but just be shifted along the hue value.&#x20;
* **saturation mode** -&#x20;
  * OFF - saturation isn't changed
  * FIXED - saturation is fixed at the specified value.&#x20;
* **brightness mode** -
  * OFF - brightness isn't changed
  * FIXED - brightness of elements is set to the brightness value
  * MULTIPLY - brightness of elements is combined with the brightness value, so if they're flashing they'll still flash, but only up to the brightness specified here.&#x20;
* **blend** - how strongly the colour changer is applied, 0% is not at all, 100% is full, and 50% is a combination of the existing colour and the new values.&#x20;
