## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" data-size="line">Â  Mirror

Makes a mirrored duplicate of all the content. By default the mirror axis is a vertical line in the middle.&#x20;

* **angle** - the angle of the mirror axis line.&#x20;
* **offset position** - shifts the mirror axis (moves perpendicular to the axis)&#x20;
* **delay** - time delay of the mirrored content. Note that this will only have an effect if the content has some kind of animation.&#x20;

#### 3D options (available when 3D is selected)

* **angle X / angle Y** - the mirror axis becomes a plane and you can use these settings to rotate the plane in 3D.

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" data-size="line">Â  Circular Pattern

Duplicates content in a circular pattern.&#x20;

* **radius** - the distance from the centre point that the content is shifted before rotating.&#x20;
* **count** - the number of copies of the object to make.&#x20;
* **use each objects pivot point** - when selected, each element will be shifted and rotated around its own centre point. (Only has an effect when there are multiple elements being duplicated)
* **delay** - adds a progressively longer time delay to each duplicated element. Note that the content needs to have some kind of animation for this to have a noticeable effect.
* **rotation** - an offset rotation added to the elements.&#x20;

#### 3D options (available when 3D is selected)

* **rotation x / rotation y**  - rotates the entire circular pattern around the x and y axes.&#x20;

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" data-size="line">Â  Grid Pattern

Duplicates content in a grid pattern of rows and columns.&#x20;

* **spacing** - the distance between the elements
* **count X**- the number of copies horizontally (columns)
* **count Y**- the number of copies vertically (rows)
* **horizontal alignment** - the starting point of the columns, LEFT, CENTRE or RIGHT
* **vertical alignment** - the starting point of the rows, TOP, MIDDLE or BOTTOM
* **delay** - adds a progressively longer time delay to each duplicated element. Note that the content needs to have some kind of animation for this to have a noticeable effect.
