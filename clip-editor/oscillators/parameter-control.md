# ✅ Parameter Control

## <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">  Parameter Control

The _Parameter Control_ is a method for controlling various settings within a effect or a clip outside of the clip editor.

* **range min / range max** - the minimum and maximum values the parameter level is mapped onto
* **level** - the default setting for this parameter. This is the value that can be changed from the outside. You can manually adjust it to see the effect it will have.
* **parameter number** - every _parameter control_ can be assigned a number, and this is reflected on the controls outside of the clip. You can have more than one parameter control with the same number, and they are all adjusted at the same time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only parameter 1 of an effect is available to control with the APC40. All parameters within effects and clips are available in the right click menu. In the future more of these parameters will be mappable with MIDI controllers.
