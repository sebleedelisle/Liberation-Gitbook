# ðŸŸ¦ Co-ordinate system

Clip content uses an x/y co-ordinate system where the origin (0,0) is at the centre of the screen.&#x20;

* In the horizontal axis x, left is negative, right is positive.
* In the vertical axis y, up is negative, down is positive.&#x20;

The clip has a width and height of 400 pixels, so the visible area co-ordinates range from -200 to 200.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The clip editor creates _vector_ shapes. This means that they are not stored as pixels but as sets of co-ordinates that define how the shapes are drawn. This is similar to how Inkscape or Illustrator defines content, as opposed to Photoshop.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 3D

Additionally you can move around in 3D space, forwards and backwards along the z axis. By default everything is at the z position of 0.&#x20;

* In the z axis, backwards away from you is negative, forwards towards you is positive.
