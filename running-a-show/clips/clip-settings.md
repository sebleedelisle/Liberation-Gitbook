Change the output size of the clip using _Scale X_ and _Scale Y_. They are locked together unless you press the _SHIFT_ key.&#x20;

Change the horizontal and vertical position of the clip using _Shift X_ and _Shift Y_.

_Zone Chase_ is such an amazing feature it gets its own section. [zone-delay-chase.md](zone-delay-chase.md "mention")

### Locking clips

If a clip is locked, it can't be moved or deleted. To lock a clip, use the _Locked_ checkbox in the right-click menu. In the Clip settings panel you get some more options.

* _UNLOCK ALL -_ unlocks every clip in the clip deck.&#x20;
* _AUTO-LOCK_ - when _Auto-Lock_ is on, any clip that is played automatically (either with the timeline or MIDI record/playback system) will be locked. This is useful if you've programmed a show in Logic Pro (or similar) and do not want to accidentally edit the clips used in the show.&#x20;
* _LOCKED CLIPS ZONES_ - if this is on then you can't change the zones for any locked clip
* _LOCKED CLIPS PARAMS_ - if this is on then you can't change the parameters (scale, shift etc) for any locked clip.&#x20;

### Right click menu

If you right click on a clip, a menu appears with some of the options for that clip. See [clip-editor.md](../../designing-content/clip-editor.md "mention"), [organising-your-clip-deck.md](../../designing-content/organising-your-clip-deck.md "mention") and [groups.md](groups.md "mention")for more about the first few items in this menu.&#x20;

### Retrigger

When _Retrigger_ is enabled, the clip will always restart from whenever it is started. This is the default as it's usually the best option, especially if you are not 100% locked in with the music.&#x20;

If _Retrigger_ is not enabled, the clip will always be in time with the beat - it's as though the clip was started at the very beginning of the clock. It's good for when you are synchronised perfectly with the music via an external clock signal. &#x20;
