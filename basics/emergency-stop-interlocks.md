# âœ… Emergency stop / interlocks

Powering up your lasers can be fun, but it's critically important that you can also _stop_ them! Laser hardware and software is generally very reliable but everything can fail. And on the rare occasion that it does, you'll be very thankful for that remote stop button.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Power tools and heavy equipment have stop buttons that just interrupt the main power supply, but you should **never** do this on laser equipment! The lasers will always take a moment to stop emitting, and a sudden power outage can cause the laser scanners to hit their extremes. So you are likely to get a strong beam in unexpected places!

That's why lasers have built-in interlock and remote stop systems that disarm and arm the laser controllably.&#x20;

**Always use remote stop buttons**, even when using your lasers in private controlled spaces. You never know when someone might randomly walk into the path of the laser, or have an unexpected strong beam that starts burning the plasterwork (ask me how I know).&#x20;
