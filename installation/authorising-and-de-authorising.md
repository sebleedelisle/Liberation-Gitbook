# âœ… Authorising and de-authorising

### Authorising Liberation

When you open Liberation for the first time, it'll run in _demo mode_ and you'll see the _About panel:_

Click on the _AUTHORISE ONLINE_ button and your web browser will open. If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted to do so now.&#x20;

The system will now automatically authorise your installation with your subscription, and you'll see this message:

When you return to Liberation you'll see the _About panel_ has updated (you may have to wait a few seconds).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have already authorised the maximum number of computers for your subscription, you will need to deauthorise one of your other machines or upgrade your subscription.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have multiple subscriptions, you will be prompted to choose the subscription that you want to assign the computer.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Congratulations! Your Liberation install has now been authorised and you can output to lasers! But please read the [getting-started.md](../basics/getting-started.md "mention")and [setting-up-lasers.md](../setting-up/setting-up-lasers.md "mention") before arming your lasers.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can open the _About panel_ at any time via _Menu -> Window -> About Panel_ or  _Menu -> Settings -> Authorise/Deauthorise this computer_
{% endhint %}

### De-authorising Liberation

While online, click _DEAUTHORISE COMPUTER_ in the _About panel_. That's it!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only de-authorise Liberation from the computer that has been authorised! If you need a remote de-authorisation you will need to contact support, and this can only be done once per subscription period.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
