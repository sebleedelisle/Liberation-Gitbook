# âœ… How licensing works

Once you have installed Liberation on your computer it will run in _demo mode_ until you _authorise_ it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
There are no restrictions in _demo mode_ apart from outputting to laser hardware. You can practice shows, build timelines, and save and load your files without limitations. You can install Liberation in _demo mode_ on as many computers as you like, and you only need to authorise your installation when you are ready to use lasers!
{% endhint %}

There is a limit to the number of computers you can authorise Liberation on dependent on your subscription tier :&#x20;

| Subscription tier | Number of computers |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Hobbyist          | 1                   |
| Professional      | 2                   |
| Unlimited         | 3                   |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that for professional installations and shows you should **always** have a spare authorised computer at the ready!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Internet connectivity

Liberation's licensing and authorisation works over the internet; the app connects to our server to associate an installation with your subscription.&#x20;

Once your installation is authorised it doesn't need to be online again until your subscription renews. You can see the renewal date in the _About panel._ There is a short grace period (7 days for monthly subscriptions) but it is recommended to go online as soon as possible after the renewal date to make sure your authorisation renews and remains active. &#x20;
