# âœ… Upgrade / downgrade your license

You can upgrade to a higher tier at any time. You will get a partial refund for the remaining time on your current subscription, and your new plan will start immediately.

You can also downgrade at any time but it will not take effect until your renewal date.&#x20;

Log in to the website, open the _My subscriptions_ page, select the subscription you want to change, then click the _UPGRADE/DOWNGRADE_ link. You will then see the available options for your license.&#x20;

Click the relevant _PREVIEW_ button to see how the changes would affect your payments. If you're happy with the change, then click the _Confirm subscription change_ button to complete the process.
