# 🟩 Transfer your content when upgrading to a new version

Liberation stores content in its working folder, (see [where-to-find-the-working-folder.md](../troubleshooting/where-to-find-the-working-folder.md "mention") ) and this changes for every new version release. If you want to keep your working files from the old version to the new one :&#x20;

1. Open the original version of Liberation
2. Use _File->Project->Export Project_. This saves everything in your Liberation, the laser setup, timelines, clip deck, everything!&#x20;
3. Close this version then open the new version of Liberation
4. Use _File->Project->Import Project_ and select the project file you exported in step 2.&#x20;

All of your content should now be in the new version.

#### Keeping multiple versions of Liberation

Before installing a new version, rename the old version - I usually use its version number ie Liberation103.app (or .exe on Windows) You can keep as many versions of Liberation as you like, but can only run one at a time. <br>

#### If you overwrote your old version of Liberation with a newer version

The most reliable option would be to reinstall the older version of Liberation and then carry out the process as described above.&#x20;

Alternatively you can try copying your working folder and renaming it to the number of the new version.&#x20;
