# 🟩 Re-ordering beam zones

Beam zones appear in the order that you create them, but you can re-order them after the fact. Open _View -> Beam Zone Organiser._

You'll see the list of beam zones and which laser they are connected to. Drag and drop the zones to put them in the order you want, or click _Autosort by laser_ to automatically sort them consecutively depending on the laser they are in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you haven't given your beam zones custom names, they will use a default name of _Beam 1, Beam 2,_ etc. If you re-order them, their default names will also update depending on their sort order. Be aware of this while you are re-ordering zones as it could be confusing.
{% endhint %}
