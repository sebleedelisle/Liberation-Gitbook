Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Click and drag on any empty space (or on locked zones) to move the view around.&#x20;

* Add beam zone to the laser
* Select which canvas zones are in this laser&#x20;
* Add a mask to the laser
* Toggle the test pattern for this laser
* Choose the test pattern for this laser (overrides the main test pattern)
* Toggle snapping to the grid
* Adjust the grid size (0 smallest - 8 largest). (Note that grid sizes increase by a power of 2 so when you reduce the size of the grid all of your snapped points are still in line).
