# ðŸŸ¦ Copy zones between lasers

Click on the _COPY LASER SETTINGS_ button in _Laser Output_ and a new window will open.&#x20;

This is an incredibly useful and time saving feature for quickly copying zones and other settings from one laser to the others.&#x20;

Make sure you have selected the laser you want to copy settings _from._&#x20;

Toggle on all the other lasers you want to copy settings _to_. (Use _ALL_ and _NONE_ to make this quicker if you have a lot of lasers)

Select the _Copy output zone settings_ option and then click the _COPY SETTINGS_ button to complete the process.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that this process will not add or remove zones from lasers. It will merely copy the position and type of zone for each zone that exists in the target lasers.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
