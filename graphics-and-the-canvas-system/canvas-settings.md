# ðŸŸ¦ Canvas settings

Click on the _Canvas settings_ button at the top of the left hand tool bar to open the _Canvas settings_ panel. &#x20;

### Width and Height

Use these draggable sliders to change the overall width and height of the entire canvas. These dimensions can be notionally considered as pixel size, but it's all relative.&#x20;

Double click on a slider to type a value.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Here's some extra nerdy detail: the laser moves relative to the canvas resolution, not relative to the zone size. This is because a large zone in the canvas is likely to be projected onto a larger area in real life.&#x20;

It's a minor detail that likely won't matter to you, but it should help to even out the performance and visibility across your canvas zones.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Zone brightness&#x20;

Use this to change how bright the pink zone outlines appear in the Canvas view. This can help with clarity of your content, and to stop this view getting too cluttered.&#x20;
