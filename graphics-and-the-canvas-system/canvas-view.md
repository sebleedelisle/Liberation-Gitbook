# 🟩 Canvas view

Select the _CANVAS_ view by clicking on the _CANVAS_ button in the top tool bar.

The Canvas view is a representation of the full canvas - this is the area you have to play with and add content to. In this view you can choose which parts of the canvas go to which zones, and add guide images.

### Navigating around the Canvas view

&#x20;Click and drag on any empty space (or on locked zones) to move the view around.

### Zoom in and out of the Canvas view

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

### Toolbar icons

On the left of the view you'll see the toolbar. Hover your mouse over any icon to see what it does.

* Open the _Canvas settings_ panel
* Add a new canvas zone
* Add a new guide image
* Toggle snapping to the grid
* Adjust the grid size (0 smallest - 8 largest). (Note that grid sizes increase by a power of 2 so when you reduce the size of the grid all of your snapped points are still in line).
* Show / hide the grid
