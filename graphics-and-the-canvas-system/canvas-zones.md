# ðŸŸ¦ Canvas zones

A canvas zone is represented in the canvas view as a pink outline rectangle. It is used to select a rectangular area within the canvas and send its content to one or more lasers.&#x20;

You can click and drag the zones around with the mouse. Drag the corners to change the size and shape.&#x20;

### Add a new canvas zone

Click the _Add a new canvas zone_ button in the tool bar.&#x20;

### Assign the canvas zone to a laser

Right-click on the zone and toggle the number buttons to select which laser(s) this canvas zone is assigned to.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
WARNING - if the laser is armed you could suddenly start projecting content in a default canvas zone. It's best to disarm the laser before assigning canvas zones to it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you now go to the _OUTPUT_ view for that laser you'll see the canvas zone in there, which can now be edited exacltly like any beam zone. See [zones.md](../output-view/zones.md "mention").&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also add a canvas zone to a laser directly from the _OUTPUT_ view - click the _Add existing canvas zone_ button in the left hand toolbar.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Right-click menu

You can also delete this canvas zone, move it to the back and lock it, all from the right-click menu.
