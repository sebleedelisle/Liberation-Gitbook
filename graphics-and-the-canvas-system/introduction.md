# 🟩 Introduction

These days lasers are more commonly employed to create beams and atmospheric effects in the air, rather than projecting visuals onto surfaces. I would even go so far to say that projecting graphics with lasers is often seen as un-cool, due largely to the proliferation of poor quality clip art animations and questionable content so often provided as presets.&#x20;

But the thing is; laser graphics can be incredibly versatile, giving you a vast array of creative opportunities.  Whether a simple sparkly corporate logo (yes we've all been there) to a fully mapped architectural façade, we've got you covered.&#x20;

By using mapped graphics and custom animation you open yourself up to a whole new world of creative opportunities to add to your toolkit.&#x20;
